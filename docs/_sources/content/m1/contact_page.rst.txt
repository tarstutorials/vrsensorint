**Email:** ecmatzek@gmail.com

Ethan Matzek is a graduate Computer Science student at Wright State University who specializes in hardware and software support in physiological sensing, and virtual reality development. He wrote up most of the documentation for the first, second, fourth, and fifth modules, and was the project lead for this site. Ethan is an avid pianist, reader, and gym-goer, and has found success in his paper *VRMonic: A VR Piano Playing Form Trainer* which was demoed at the AIxVR 2024 conference in Los Angeles. He attended CVPR 2024 as an demo exhibitionist for physiological sensing in VR. He also publish a paper titled *VitaMaze: A VR Exergame Driven using Feedback from Physiological Sensors* which was published at AIxVR 2025.

**Email:** avamegyeri1@gmail.com

Ava Megyeri is a graduate Computer Science student at Wright State university. Her research is focused in Robotics, specifically human-robot collaboration, looking into how robots can hand off objects in a more human like / natural way. She was second author in HOH: Markerless Multimodal Human-Object-Human Handover Dataset with Large Object Count, the largest handover dataset in number of objects, participants, pairs with role reversal accounted for, and total interactions captured. She also has two first author papers out in IEEE RO-MAN 2024. In her free time she plays basketball and volunteers at a cat shelter. Recently, she attended CVPR 2024 as a demo exhibitionist for physiological sensing with Robotics.
