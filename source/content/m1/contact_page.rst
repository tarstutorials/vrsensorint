**Email:** avamegyeri1@gmail.com

Ava Megyeri is a graduate Computer Science student at Wright State university. Her research is focused in Robotics, specifically human-robot collaboration, looking into how robots can hand off objects in a more human like / natural way. She was second author in HOH: Markerless Multimodal Human-Object-Human Handover Dataset with Large Object Count, the largest handover dataset in number of objects, participants, pairs with role reversal accounted for, and total interactions captured. She also has two first author papers out in IEEE RO-MAN 2024. In her free time she plays basketball and volunteers at a cat shelter. Recently, she attended CVPR 2024 as a demo exhibitionist for physiological sensing with Robotics.
